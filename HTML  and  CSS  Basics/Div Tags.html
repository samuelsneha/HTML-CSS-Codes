	<!-- I inserted the Image 1, first through the file explorer I inserted into the basics folder, which then got reflected here in the sublime's basics folder also. REMEMBER, its not possible to directly insert an image file into the basics ( or any folder ) of the sublime, and expecting it to be reflected on the file explorer. Only if you you make any changes in the file explorer, that gets reflected on the sublime folder for image files. But if you want you can create a .html file here in the sublime first and that will get reflected on the file explorer, but for image files thats not possible. -->
